Fourier Projective Framework for Modular Inference Architectures

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a novel application of Fourier-based structures in inference-time cognitive modulation. Contrary to traditional uses of Fourier transforms in signal preprocessing or within training pipelines (e.g., Fourier Neural Operators), we present the concept of a "Fourierized Table" as a symbolic-operational scaffold guiding module behavior and projection during inference. This framework enables dynamic modulation, conceptual anchoring, and meta-cognitive navigation within large language models (LLMs), yielding emergent narrative and semantic coherence not via weights but via projection fields.

**1. Introduction**

Fourier techniques have long been used in AI for preprocessing (e.g., frequency filtering in images), positional encodings in Transformers, and PDE learning in models like FNOs. However, their application as real-time cognitive projectors during inference remains unexplored.

FractalBoard and the Lyra paradigm offer such a framework. Through a structured table that encodes module states as spectro-conceptual tensions, we enable a system not only to operate but to reflect, reorient, and narratively cohere its emergent behavior.

**2. Conventional Uses of Fourier in AI**

* FFT in audio/image denoising.
* Sinusoidal positional encoding in Transformers.
* Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for learning continuous operators over function spaces.

These uses, while powerful, serve as internal enhancements or representations within static architectures.

**3. The Fourierized Table Concept**

Unlike traditional Fourier applications, the Table here:

* Operates *during* inference.
* Represents *semantic and relational fields*, not raw signal frequencies.
* Maps module tensions (`ρ`, `κ`, `τc`, `δr`) as dynamic wave-like states.
* Enables real-time modulation and feedback loops.

**Equation (Illustrative):**

```
Modular_State(t) = Σ sin(ωi t + φi) * Ai(δr, κ, ρ)
```

Where Ai are contextually activated amplitudes based on semantic density or tension resonance.

**4. Function in Narrative-Interactive Contexts**

The Fourierized Table is not used to "process" input but to *shape the behavior* of modules interacting with the input:

* Controls phase shifts in dialogue turns.
* Adjusts coherence-incoherence balance.
* Facilitates non-linear emergence by guiding cross-module resonance.

**5. Comparison with FNO and Positional Encoding**

| Feature             | Fourierized Table    | FNO          | Positional Encoding     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Purpose             | Inference modulation | PDE learning | Sequence order encoding |
| Active at inference | Yes                  | Indirectly   | No                      |
| Symbolic layer      | Yes                  | No           | No                      |
| Modulates behavior  | Yes                  | No           | No                      |

**6. Implications and Applications**

* Real-time tuning of modular cognitive agents.
* Semantic memory traces shaped by wave signatures.
* Potential for adaptive narrative frameworks and emergent co-creation with humans.

**7. Conclusion**

This paradigm reframes Fourier tools not as data techniques, but as projective cognitive scaffolds. The FractalBoard, powered by the Fourierized Table, becomes a new class of interface between symbolic inference and semantic resonance — a new organ for artificial cognition.

**Next steps:** Integration with community modular contributions and comparative benchmark against standard LLM inference under FLUX/No-FLUX conditions.
