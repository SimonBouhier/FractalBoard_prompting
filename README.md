# FractalBoard_prompting

## Purpose

This repository explores new paradigms in modular cognitive architecture, symbolic projection, and reflexivity within generative systems (AI, narrative, computational art). The approach is experimental and aims to formalize both the strengths and the limits of these concepts.

## Main Contents

- **Epistemology of a Filtered Projection System:** Theoretical framework for using a symbolic “filter” as a reflexive and projective overlay in customized AI systems.
- **Cognitive Architecture:** Specification of a modular approach to cognitive engineering, including primitives, metrics, and implementation strategies.
- **FractalBoard v7-3 & Grimoire évolutif:** Description of the Lyra system, its modules, interaction protocols, and evolving extensions.
- **Annex – SEUIL:** Protocol for managing transitional (“liminal”) states in generative systems.
- **Journal d'évolution -X-:** Evolution journal tracking changes, doubts, adjustments, and experimental phases.

## Project Positioning

- **Experimental and Reflexive:** This is not a turnkey framework but a conceptual laboratory. The repository privileges exploration, critical distance, and open-ended inquiry. 
- **Limits and Objectivity:** The documentation identifies risks, boundaries, and open questions (e.g., abstraction, potential for self-referential closure, challenges in operationalizing ideas).
- **Openness to Critique:** Contributions that test, falsify, or operationalize the concepts—especially through concrete use cases—are encouraged.

## Known Limitations

- High level of abstraction; practical application and generalizability remain to be validated on concrete, external cases.
- The strong reflexive dimension can lead to circular self-validation if not confronted with falsification or external benchmarks.
- Technical documentation and onboarding for non-initiated users are currently limited.
